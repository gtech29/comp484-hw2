## Assignment Overview

For this HW, the goal is to plan and implement a **semantic structuring strategy** for the entire site based on the lecture content.

## 1) Determine a structuring strategy (Applies to: `structure.html`)

Work completed:

- Explored page structure.html structure and existing aria roles
- Identified the use of structural tags (e.g. aside, article, nav, section)
- Examined semantic layout tags (header, main, footer)
- Created structure diagram (based on lecture slide #7) and saved screen shot in /images
- Produced document outline by using an outline tool (based on lecture slide #10) Create a screenshot in /images

**Screenshots location:**

- `/images/structure_diagram.jpg`
- `/images/outline.png`

## 2) Structure pages (Applies to: all pages)

Completed tasks:

- Used the semantic strategy derived from `structure.html`
- Updated the remaining pages to use a consistent and logical semantic structure across the site

## 3) Apply ARIA roles (Applies to: all pages)

Completed tasks:

- Added ARIA roles where necessary and laid out the pages in such a way that they were user friendly and could be read by the assistive technology.
