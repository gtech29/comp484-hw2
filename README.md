**Repo:** https://github.com/gtech29/comp484-hw2
**Live site (GitHub Pages):** https://gtech29.github.io/comp484-hw2/

## Assignment Overview

For this HW, the goal is to plan and implement a **semantic structuring strategy** for the entire site based on the lecture content.

---

## 1) Determine a structuring strategy (Applies to: `structure.html`) 

Work completed:

- Explored `structure.html` page structure and existing ARIA roles
- Identified how structural tags are used (e.g., `aside`, `article`, `nav`, `section`)
- Examined semantic layout tags (`header`, `main`, `footer`)
- Created a **structure diagram** (based on lecture slide #7) and saved a screenshot in `/images`
- Produced a **document outline** using an outline tool (based on lecture slide #10) and saved a screenshot in `/images`

**Screenshots location:**

- `/images/structure_diagram.jpg`
- `/images/outline.png`

## 2) Structure pages (Applies to: all pages)

Completed tasks:

- Used the semantic strategy derived from `structure.html`
- Updated the remaining pages to use a consistent and logical semantic structure across the site

---

## 3) Apply ARIA roles (Applies to: all pages)

Completed tasks:

- Added ARIA roles where appropriate while structuring the pages to support accessibility and assistive technologies
